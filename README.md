## Joseph Newman

Teacher to father to software developer.

I’ve flirted with tech throughout my career, drawn to its power to engage, connect and innovate. The birth of my son led me to reassess, and I came to the realisation that, while education will always hold a special significance,  I desired more for my family, than afforded by my teaching role, and that I needed a new challenge with some other work that I found meaningful. Software development and the tech/ startup scene, with its open, people-first culture and exciting prospects for the future, seemed like the perfect choice. Having completed a **[Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy)** bootcamp, I’m ready for the next step.

## Work Experience
  
### Various schools
_Teacher_ (2011 to 2021)      (London: **[SJA](https://www.st-joanofarc.islington.sch.uk/)**, **[Nightingale](https://www.nightingale.redbridge.sch.uk/)**, **[Oakdale](https://www.oakdalejuniors.co.uk/)** ~~ Bangkok: **[AISB](https://www.australianisb.ac.th/)**, **[First Steps](https://www.thefirststeps.ac.th/)**, **[St Stephen's](https://www.sis.edu/)**, **[Wattana](https://www.wattana.ac.th/)**)
 
- **Presentation and communication** - Communicated information clearly in a number of formats, and understood others - students, families, colleagues, and outside agencies. Allowed me to succinctly deliver 1000s of learning episodes, as well as being a frequent confidant on communication for the business manager at First Steps.
- **Analysis and evaluation** - Used all evidence available to identify requirements (of students and curriculum), and then determine successes and areas for development - the  ‘plan, teach, assess’ cycle. Allowed me to help countless children, practice working in an Agile-like environment, and be chosen as the IT Lead at First Steps.
- **Managing time and energy** - Prioritised the most urgent, important tasks, whilst maintaining the energy to engage with students and staff, and be accountable for learning outcomes. I achieved two post-graduate qualifications whilst teaching full-time, and also working part-time, including on pioneering lucrative weekend classes at AISB.
- **Leadership** - Demonstrated authority and assurance, and motivated the students and staff, endeavouring throughout to get the best for them. Given a year group leadership in my first year as a class teacher at Wattana.
- **Thirst for knowledge** - Constantly strived to develop my knowledge of curriculum content, and the profession. Recognised as an academic authority throughout my career - “If you don’t know, ask Joe”.
- **Adaptability** - Modified the curriculum based on changing demands, both of the class, and externally. Recognised during the pandemic at Nightingale, when I was asked to deliver the online offering, with little notice or direction.
  
### **[UK Startup Jobs](https://www.ukstartupjobs.com/)** 
_Social Media Manager_ (2016 to 2019)  

- **Creativity** - Elicited the most relevant information from a range of sources, to write engaging posts and blog articles. Led to significant growth in followers, particularly on Twitter, contributing to the founder's successful exit.
- **Customer care and marketing** - Identified user and product need. Allowed me to deliver the best possible outcomes for all, whilst transforming the model for user interaction from an automated system.



## Areas of Strength

#### Deciphering

Since childhood, my job has been education: my own education; that of others; even education about education. 

From my lifelong side hustle as a geographical/ historical/ cultural research nerd, through my career as a teacher juggling my own professional development, the developing minds of the children in my care, and the requirements of multiple jobs, through to my newest and greatest challenge of raising my infant son whilst changing careers, I have never ceased my love of deconstructing concepts, assimilating them, and then discovering more. I have completed teacher training three times over, in three vastly different sets of circumstances, which has allowed me the opportunity to develop the young minds in many differing professional settings. I've also realised that a new professional challenge was the right choice for myself and my family. This has resulted in the metamorphosis of hundreds of content children and their families, and most recently, the inception of an eager, young (ish) developer.

#### Discerning

Throughout my professional career I've considered the children, their families, and my colleagues, to leverage the best possible results.

Regardless of their age, it takes some effort to fully understand a child, and this is a ceaseless effort, as children change constantly: as they grow; depending on the context; and as their moods change. This becomes all the more challenging when you consider that:

- classes in some of my roles in Bangkok were anywhere up to 40 children
- families (especially highly-professional international ones) have myriad different expectations
- interactions between the children, and the classroom team, could be happening in several possible unfamiliar languages
- senior members of staff and outside authorities like OFSTED have various, volatile expectations
                   
In each new, educational setting, and with each new class, I've used my empathy, intuition, inter-personal skills and previous experience to learn about and resolve the changing requirements of the role, and satisfy the wants and needs of all of the members of the school community.

#### Directing

As a member of the teaching profession, I had the pleasure of guiding the children under my care to become more complete versions of themselves.

Whether it be walking into an unfamiliar room to teach unknown children, marshalling experienced senior staff, or even (more topically) having extra children and staff assigned to your care with little preparation time, I've had numerous opportunities to develop my ability to lead under pressure. At Nightingale, whilst completing my NQT year, I had the added challenges of a fluid year group team, due to changing need across the school, and a mentoring role for a less-experienced teacher in the year group team, yet the head of year trusted me with extra responsibilities such as leading the lockdown online offering, making key decisions on the ongoing interpretation of the curriculum offering, and delegating to and monitoring the other members of the year group team. Whilst I am confident conducting leadership duties, I am still able to do so with compassion; on a recent visit back to First Steps I was treated to quite a few vigorous hugs from support staff, despite the expectations of social distancing.


## Education

### **[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)**
_Software development bootcamp_ (February 2022 to June 2022)

- **Planning, development and product vision** - Used TDD and modelling to develop and deliver vision according to the requirements of the project. Delivered projects listed above.
- **Self-directed learning and skill acquisition** - Throughout the course, which was run on a distance-learning model. Allowed me to develop knowledge of key concepts and industry best-practices (e.g. MVC, OOP, Separation of Concerns, Agile) and gain experience with tech such as: _Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Node, ERB, Sinatra, React, RSpec, Jest, Capybara, Cypress, PostgreSQL, MongoDB & Mongoose_.


### **[Teach in Redbridge](https://fipc.ac.uk/teach-in-redbridge/)**
_Schools Direct ITT_ (2019 to 2020)
- **Composure** - Learned the particularities of teaching in the UK: sophisticated differentiation and assessment, differing demands of students and their families, and fewer resources, in an intense year of work and study. Allowed me to develop my skills in maintaining calm and assurance under pressure.


### **[Nottingham University](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/education/study/pgcei/index.aspx)**
_PGCEi_ (2014 to 2015)
- **Self-motivation** - Elected to take on a postgraduate qualification online, to further my understanding of my profession. Passed with distinction, enabled better outcomes for the children under my care at that time and afterwards, and taught myself that the remote model works for me when necessary.


### **[Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/chemistry)**
_Chemistry with Sport Science BSc_ (2007 to 2010)
- **Problem-solving** - Completed 100s of hours of labs across physiology, biomechanics, organic and inorganic chemistry, amongst others, allowing me to develop skills in scientific, logical analysis.

## Hobbies

**Climbing** - Particularly boulders made of plastic

**Fitness** - Cycling, swimming, rowing, football when I can get it. Children also make great, progressive, albeit slighly-fragile weights

**Travel** - International, when possible. I also enjoy a good walk

**Food** - Fried and/or spicy usually preferable

**Puzzles** - Sudoku ++
