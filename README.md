## Joseph Newman

I love working with children. After I started collaborating one of my own, I decided to build other things too.

Teacher to father to fullstack developer.

So far I've been doing Ruby and JavaScript. I want to do even more.

#### Deciphering

Since childhood, my job has been education: my own education; that of others; even education about education. 

From my lifelong side hustle as a geographical/ historical/ cultural research nerd, through my career as a teacher juggling my own professional development, the developing minds of the children in my care, and the requirements of multiple jobs, through to my newest and greatest challenge of raising my infant son whilst changing careers, I have never ceased my love of deconstructing concepts, assimilating them, and then discovering more. I have completed teacher training three times over, in three vastly different sets of circumstances, which has allowed me the opportunity to develop the young minds in many differing professional settings. I've also realised that a new professional challenge was the right choice for myself and my family. This has resulted in the metamorphosis of hundreds of content children and their families, and most recently, the inception of an eager, young (ish) developer.

#### Discerning

Throughout my professional career I've considered the children, their families, and my colleagues, to leverage the best possible results.

Regardless of their age, it takes some effort to fully understand a child, and this is a ceaseless effort, as children change constantly: as they grow; depending on the context; and as their moods change. This becomes all the more challenging when you consider that:

- classes in some of my roles in Bangkok were anywhere up to 40 children
- families (especially highly-professional international ones) have myriad different expectations
- interactions between the children, and the classroom team, could be happening in several possible unfamiliar languages
- senior members of staff and outside authorities like OFSTED have various, volatile expectations
                   
In each new, educational setting, and with each new class, I've used my empathy, intuition, inter-personal skills and previous experience to learn about and resolve the changing requirements of the role, and satisfy the wants and needs of all of the members of the school community.


#### Directing

As a member of the teaching profession, I had the pleasure of guiding the children under my care to become more complete versions of themselves.

Whether it be walking into an unfamiliar room to teach unknown children, marshalling experienced senior staff, or even (more topically) having extra children and staff assigned to your care with little preparation time, I've had numerous opportunities to develop my ability to lead under pressure. At Nightingale, whilst completing my NQT year, I had the added challenges of a fluid year group team, due to changing need across the school, and a mentoring role for a less-experienced teacher in the year group team, yet the head of year trusted me with extra responsibilites such as leading the lockdown online offering, making key decisions on the ongoing interpretation of the curriculum offering, and delegating to and monitoring the other members of the year group team. Whilst I am confident conducting leadership duties, I am still able to do so with compassion; on a recent visit back to First Steps I was treated to quite a few vigorous hugs from support staff, despite the expectations of social distancing.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (February 2022 to June 2022)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Teach in Redbridge (2019 to 2020)

- PGCE - An education post-graduate course
- Learning lots of competing and inter-connected theories of teaching and learning
- I had practice in breaking complicated topics down into easy-to-understand steps, frequent testing to prevent misunderstandings, and adapting for individual needs

#### Nottingham University (2014 to 2015)

- PGCEi - An education post-graduate course, with a distance-learning model
- Acing a university post-graduate year, whilst working a full-time job, along with extra part-time work, taught me that the remote model works well for me when necessary 
- I had to prioritise different commitments at different times, whilst continually considering the welfare and development of the children under my care, and accruing necessary experience and eveidence to present my own learning

#### Stanton School (September 2012)

- CELTA - Teaching English as a Foreign Language
- I learnt to recognise the challenges and perks of learning new languages
- I already knew how the grammar worked, but I realised that learning the technical terms made it much easier to explain how the grammar worked

#### Loughborough University (2007 to 2010)

- Chemistry with Sport Science BSc
- My university experience taught me the essential skills of adulthood
- I've kept a passion for sports. I'm fascinated by the sciences, and chemistry certainly helped me develop my analytical skills
- I helped raise 1000s of pounds for charity on Rag Raids, and discovered a love of the potato dog - Google it



## Hobbies

**Climbing** - Particularly boulders made of plastic

**Fitness** - Cycling, swimming, rowing, football when I can get it. Children also make great, progressive, albeit slighly-fragile weights

**Travel** - International, when possible. I also enjoy a good walk

**Food** - Fried and/or spicy usually preferable

**Puzzles** - Sudoku ++
