## Joseph Newman

Teacher to father to software developer.

I’ve flirted with tech throughout my career, drawn to its power to engage, connect and innovate. The birth of my son led me to reassess, and I came to the realisation that, while education will always hold a special significance,  I desired more for my family, than afforded by my teaching role, and that I needed a new challenge with some other work that I found meaningful. Software development and the tech/ startup scene, with its open, people-first culture and exciting prospects for the future, seemed like the perfect choice. Having completed a **[Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy)** bootcamp, and landed my first role at **[Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/)** as a Backend Java Engineer, I'm looking to keep growing.

## Areas of Strength

### Deciphering

Since childhood, my job has been education: my own education; that of others; even education about education. I love of **deconstructing** concepts, **assimilating** them, and then **discovering** more. I've used this skill to:

- Guide myself through my **career as a teacher** simulataneously considering the requirements of **multiple jobs**. This has allowed me to help 1000s of children from a wide variety of backgrounds.
- Complete **teacher training three times** over, in three vastly different sets of circumstances. With each challenge, new opportunities were uncovered.
- Undertake the necessary training to **change my career** whilst raising my infant son. I've transformed my professional prospects, the right choice for myself and my family.

### Discerning

Throughout my professional career I've considered the children, their families, and my colleagues, to leverage the best possible results. In each new, educational setting, and with each new class, I've used my **empathy**, **intuition**, **inter-personal skills** and previous experience to learn about and resolve the changing requirements of each role. I've used this skill to:

- Consider all under my care in classes of up to **40 children**. Using this information to plan and deliver the most meaningful lessons for the group.
- Liaise with a **myriad of families** with differing expectations. I was able to give advice and enact change for the benefit of their children.
- Monitor classroom interactions in **multiple languages**. This allowed me make adaptations to the lesson being delivered, and inform assessment and future planning.
- Recognise **various, volatile expectations** of senior members of staff and outside agencies. I used this knowledge to evidence and deliver practice which satisfied colleagues, whilst considering those most important - the children.

### Directing

As a member of the teaching profession, I had the pleasure of **leading** those under my care, **motivating** and **advising** the staff I was working with, whilst **guiding** and **supporting** the children under my care to become more complete versions of themselves. I've used this skill to:

- **Engender respect** - This allowed me to perform meaningful work when walking into an unfamiliar room to teach unknown children, and delegate work to colleagues to benefit students.
- **Adapt to changing teams** - This meant I was able to utilise resources efficiently when having extra children and staff assigned to my care, often mid-lesson, or adapt longer-term planning as year group staff structure is reorganised, sometimes in the middle of a week.
- **Demonstrate poise** - I've used this skill to take on mentoring roles for less-experienced teachers, and be trusted with decision-making on the curriculum offering
- **Lead with compassion** - This has meant that I have maintained good relationships with colleagues, often beyond our time working together.


## Education

### **[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)**
_Software development bootcamp_ (February 2022 to June 2022)
- **Teamwork and communication** - Excelled in pair programming, stand-ups, retros, and regular team check-ins. Managed shifting team dynamics throughout the course, and skills were recognised when I was chosen to lead a cohort retro mid-way through the course.
- **Planning, development and product vision** - Used TDD and modelling to develop and deliver vision according to the requirements of the project. Delivered projects listed above.
- **Self-directed learning and skill acquisition** - Throughout the course, which was run on a distance-learning model. Allowed me to develop knowledge of key concepts and industry best-practices (e.g. MVC, OOP, Separation of Concerns, Agile) and gain experience with tech such as: _Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Node, ERB, Sinatra, React, RSpec, Jest, Capybara, Cypress, PostgreSQL, MongoDB & Mongoose_.


### **[Teach in Redbridge](https://fipc.ac.uk/teach-in-redbridge/)**
_Schools Direct ITT_ (2019 to 2020)
- **Composure** - Learned the particularities of teaching in the UK: sophisticated differentiation and assessment, differing demands of students and their families, and fewer resources, in an intense year of work and study. Allowed me to develop my skills in maintaining calm and assurance under pressure.


### **[Nottingham University](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/education/study/pgcei/index.aspx)**
_PGCEi_ (2014 to 2015)
- **Self-motivation** - Elected to take on a postgraduate qualification online, to further my understanding of my profession. Passed with distinction, enabled better outcomes for the children under my care at that time and afterwards, and taught myself that the remote model works for me when necessary.


### **[Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/chemistry)**
_Chemistry with Sport Science BSc_ (2007 to 2010)
- **Problem-solving** - Completed 100s of hours of labs across physiology, biomechanics, organic and inorganic chemistry, amongst others, allowing me to develop skills in scientific, logical analysis.
- **Selflessness** - Gave up my time to go on regular charity fundraising trips (Rag Raids), helping to raise £1000s for various charities.

### Stanton School
CELTA - Teaching English as a Foreign Language (September 2012)
- **Technical precision** - Practised discussing grammatical concepts (which I intuitively already understood) made me realise the merits of technical precision.

## Hobbies

**Climbing** - Particularly boulders made of plastic

**Fitness** - Cycling, swimming, rowing, football when I can get it. Children also make great, progressive, albeit slighly-fragile weights

**Travel** - International, when possible. I also enjoy a good walk

**Food** - Fried and/or spicy usually preferable

**Puzzles** - Sudoku ++
